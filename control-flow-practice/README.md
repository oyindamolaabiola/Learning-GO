// Task: Build a CLI Calculator

// Requirements:
// Program should keep running until the user types quit.
// Each loop: ask for two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
// Use fmt.Scanln to read the inputs.
// Perform the calculation and print the result.
// Handle invalid inputs gracefully (e.g., operator not recognized).
